Components to AI system:
Decision making - how an AI decides high-level goal
Action sequencing - What sequence of actions is required to achieve goal
Pathfinding - how to go about specific step

"smart objects" - objects store how they can be interacted with
central planner - chief in game. Holds stats on the value of actions, so if there's a lot of food stockpiled, fishing has a low value
knowledge graph - entities shouldn't have access to whole map, but need access to more than just their viewshed
current goal - entities should track current goal. Should include: actions to get there, actions achieved, momentum
